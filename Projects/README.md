## [Save the universe](https://save-the-universe-wk5-mini-project.msoro.repl.co/)

- Use Object Oriented Programming principles to create a space rudimentary game.
- I created class that two objects instances extends from. These objects have methods that alters each other's object properties.
- The UI is not required for this project, but I wanted challenge myself on creating something interactive. I started with console logging and then started altering elements in the DOM.
- This first version only plays against 6 alien ships.

## [Save the universe version 2](https://save-the-universe-wk5-mini-project-version2.msoro.repl.co/)

- I added a 3 different play modes and change scenes option.
- Instead of prompting for captains name, this version has an input box that submits to change the Hero name.
- Changing the name and scenes does not affect the game play.
